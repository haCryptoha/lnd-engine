sparkswap LND Engine
====================

The following repo contains 2 modules that make up a SparkSwap Payment Channel Network Engine:

1. NPM module w/ LND abstraction layer (located in `src`)
2. Dockerfiles for all containers needed for the LND Engine to run on a broker daemon

A current docker setup a functional BTC/LTC LND Engine:
1. Bitcoin node (currently bitcoind)
2. LND BTC node (SparkSwap fork)
3. Litecoin node (currently litecoind)
4. LND LTC node (SparkSwap fork)

#### Installation (lnd-engine only)

The following commands will install dependencies, import associated proto files for
the lnd-engine codebase and will build all docker images

```
npm run build
```

Additionally, You can then use `npm run build-images` to build docker images separately.

To run tests, use `npm run test`

#### Installation w/ Docker

The lnd-engine docker files make use of Docker's internal image storage (to replicate the functionality of docker hub locally). Run the `npm run build-images` command to
update all docker images on your local docker installation.

#### Library Usage

```
const LndEngine = require('lnd-engine')

const engineOptions = {
  logger: ...,
  tlsCertPath: /absolute/path/to/tls/cert, // required
  macaroonPath: /absolute/path/to/macaroon, // required
}

const engine = new LndEngine('0.0.0.0:10009', 'BTC', engineOptions)

engine.getUncommittedBalance.... etc
```
